# configs
Here are my config files for 'stuff'. To be explicit and to help beginners, this will contain all the customization files I typically use to personalize the various computers I work on, personalizations for various software programs  I use, and cool code snippets I use to improve my workflow. Some wide-ranging examples are:
* _pentadactylrc for the Firefox Pentadactyl plugin/addon, 
* authotkey scripts that automatically expand text strings, and 
* Preference settings for programs like Sublime Text 3

and anything else I can list out using plain text + markdown.
